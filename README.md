# 🌿 Miso GreenShop

Welcome to **Miso GreenShop** – a modern, clean, and fully functional plant eCommerce app.  
This project was built as part of my frontend developer portfolio, with a strong focus on user experience, clean architecture, and full integration with a real backend.

🔗 **Live Demo**: https://amazing-biscuit-7704bb.netlify.app/

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript** – for a scalable, typed, and structured frontend
- **CSS** – fully custom styling, no UI libraries
- **Axios** – for handling HTTP requests
- **React Context API** – for managing global state (cart, auth, etc.)

> The backend was developed by my teammate (backend dev) and follows a standard REST API architecture using `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
